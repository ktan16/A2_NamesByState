# A2_NamesByState

This algorithm is designed to take in a file from a certain directory, and these files contain data about how many times a certain name occurs within each state of the US. Each name is separated by the year in which the data was recorded, ranging from 1910 to 2020. Once the data is stored in its proper array list, the user is prompted to input a name, gender, and state so that the program can dictate the age/range of ages that said name could be.
